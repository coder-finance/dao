## What it is right now (as of 30/03/2023)
A project governance platform with automated feature and code tracking and organises payments to contributors through Ethereum, based on a combination of decentralised technologies (IPFS, Ethereum) and public centralised platforms (GitHub, Discord).

## Tenet
The belief is that it is more cost-efficient and of higher quality to invite the public to contribute to a project. New communities and monetisation opportunities can be built around these projects through consulting, bounties and workload delegation. Shared ownership of a project encourages different perspectives to help improve the project in ways infeasible or undesirable for a single entity.

## Sample Scenario 1: Commercialisation Open Source
Large companies/institutions often donate code/projects in order to help commercialise their product. For example, Apache Ray was donated by UC Berkeley RISElab, and Anyscale was formed in order to continue support and monetise this product. Similar to the Red Hat Linux (Fedora) model, Ray is free to use, but a full fledged platform and commercial support is available through Anyscale, similar to RHEL.

Anyscale benefits from the code being improved by the general public, as well as more widespread adoption. General public gets to use an execution framework developed by a cutting-edge research lab. Win-win.

Most foundation-based projects end up being collectively owned (e.g. Linux Foundation), but have maintainer(s) as custodians. Our platform will make it clear how these custodians can be financially compensated as well as given the recognition they deserve.

## Sample Scenario 2: Outsource Legacy Code to the World
Often companies have pieces of legacy technology that become undesirable to maintain in-house, while they remain crucial to day-to-day business operations. Hiring employees just to maintain this is cost-inefficient. Often times this code is non-sensitive but is just difficult to remove due to risk control.

Outsourcing to the public domain is often times desirable in this situation. In this case, our platform can help these companies connect with the required talent to outsource this work to. Clear and concise contracts can be formed quickly through an automated process on it, encouraging more to contribute, giving the patron company more access to talent in a world where appropriate hiring is a difficult if not impossible job.

## Core Qualities of the Platform
- Transparent
- Non-repudiation
- Automated
- Easily audited
- **TRUST**

### Q&A
1.  Is it a tool for developers? If so, what does it do?
	 No. This is not a tool for individual developer. This is a tool for developer(s) to involve others into their project, through either monetary compensation or reputational enhancement. The main business differentiation is that projects on this platform are of shared ownership. Everything is hosted on decentralised technological infrastructure therefore there is no central control that can override a community decision.
2.  Decentralised AWS for github? If so, what is its benefits?
	 If the projects being collected reaches a significant number, it is conceivable that the platform can become a de-facto authoritative directory where potential developers interested in developing open source software can find a project that they are interested in to contribute to. The concept is to encourage more people to contribute to open source, which at the moment have imposing barriers for.people to contribute to established projects (GNU, Apache). Bite-sized chunks in the form of bounties/outsourced mundane tasks can be an easier, more visible entry, especially for more junior developers.
3.  Incubator? How does it work as an incubator?
	 If the projects being collected hit a significant number, as well as healthy ecosystems being built around them, larger projects/teams can help incubate smaller projects by offering initial bootstrapping funding and/or code donation (e.g. via refactoring). This helps maintain a healthy ecosystem for the platform overall.

## Selling Strategy
Value is created for entities who:
* have no need to retain ownership on a project
* can benefit from having the project improved by the world
* can benefit from having a community formed around the donated project/code
* can benefit from the monetary gains posted by the patron entities
* prefer the self-service nature of the platform
* enjoys an entry ramp into the open source world
