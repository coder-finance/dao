Vitalik Buterin: **Cryptoeconomics** is fundamentally about the use of economic incentives together with cryptography to design and secure different kinds of systems and applications. the goal is â€œto reduce social trust assumptions by creating systems where we introduce explicit economic incentives for good behavior and economic penalties for ba[d] behavior.

Vote-buying, a practice usually considered anathema in legacy political systems, has risen to an art in crpytoeconomic design (Buterin et al. 2018, Automata Finance 2021), suggesting a culture in which economics is a preferable replacement for politics.
