## Summary of the above
Proposed Project Management models:
1. M1 – Many contribute, only one is awarded. Works when `money/time>threshold`, i.e. money offered are much more than cost of time to work on the contribution. Can be useful for newbies or promo contributions to get onboard. 
	```
	Open field, anybody can contribute, proposal is public (gold rush), expensive.
	```
1. M2 – Picking. Many EoI, one allowed to contribute.
2. M3 – Many contribute, one awarded with access to a list of tasks. Works when intro task is take home task or a pilot, etc.
   ```
   Task chunks, private vetting, open initial chunks, then upon contribution fulfillment, will have access to more tasks.
	```
3. M4 – Many EoI, several allowed to contribute to a list of tasks.
   ```
   Tasks chunk pools. Tasks get released in chunks to pools of contributors. Upon completion, each  pool gets further access (Private gold rush)
	```
