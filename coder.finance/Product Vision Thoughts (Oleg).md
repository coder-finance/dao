OS is always raw meat that has to be cooked into a product.

## Funding problem
If we want to distribute funds for job done then we need a source of funds, if it's a token then it has to have value.
If it is a tool for everyone to use, then who will pay to make it better? Only if there is ownership. Either pay to your people so they will help you back or pay to develop features that you need.

## Case #3 - Indie game.
Indie dev groups want to grow up as fast as they can no matter cost, because they want to secure investment.


### Upside

### Downside
 - Governance overhead. Instead of 1-3 people making decisions quickly using their comfortable way of doing things and moving to implementation qickly there is some time to vote and then apporve and release funds process.

### Case #4 - Tool for devs by devs.
Eg generic web3 frontend for hackathons or your web3 app.
