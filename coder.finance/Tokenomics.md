Token Design for the Project Governance Platform:

1. **Token Name: CODR**

    CODR will be the platformâ€™s native utility token, primarily used for project governance on a per-project basis. This token allows holders to have a say in project decision-making processes, contribute to projects, and vote on pull requests.

2. **Tokenomics and Distribution:**

    **a. Initial Distribution:** The initial token supply should be distributed amongst early investors, platform developers, and set aside in a community treasury for future project funding.

    **b. Staking:** Project stakeholders can stake CODR in specific projects. By staking tokens, they can propose new tasks, vote on pull requests, and other governance activities within that specific project. The staked tokens in a project demonstrate commitment and give the stakeholder voting power only for that project. 

    **c. Rewards:** Contributors who successfully complete tasks and have their pull requests approved will earn CODR tokens as rewards, in addition to the initially agreed-upon ETH payment.

    **d. Transaction Fees:** Small CODR transaction fees may be applied for each governance-related action (like proposing a new task or voting) to prevent spamming and provide a minor deflationary mechanism.

    **e. Burning:** A certain percentage of tokens from the transaction fees could be burned periodically to decrease the overall supply and potentially increase the token's value.

3. **Protection Against Powerful Token Holders:** 

    **a. Per-Project Governance:** CODR's governance power applies only to the project in which they're staked. Even if a token holder has a substantial amount of CODR, their power is limited to the projects they're actively involved in. Stake action should be approved by the existing maintainers. Unstake action do not require an approval, but can be executed only after a lock up period. Destroy action allows you to destroy your identity within the platform and fairly distribute your tokens to the project maintainers or burn (if not staked).

    **b. Voting Power Cap:** Implementing a cap on the voting power one stakeholder can have on a single project can prevent majority control by a single entity, ensuring a fair and democratic governance system.

    **c. Sliding Scale Voting Power:** Voting power could decrease after a certain threshold. For example, each token gives 1 vote up to 1000 tokens, after which each additional token gives only 0.5 votes, and so on. This system discourages token concentration.

    **d. Time-based Power Dilution:** If a token holder is inactive in a project for a certain period, their voting power could gradually decrease, ensuring only active members have significant influence.
    
4. Bootstrapping a project
	**a. Token Generation Event (TGE):** Each time a new project is launched, a specific number of CODR are minted for that particular project. This TGE could follow a pre-set rule such as "1,000 CODERs are created for each new project".
    
	**b. Token Distribution Mechanism:** The tokens minted for a specific project are then distributed among stakeholders. This immediate allocation incentivizes the initiation of new projects and provides initial governance power to the project's creators.

 5. Reasons to buy CODR.
	**a. Maintain governance**: Contributors accrue CODR over time becoming more powerful than the maintainers over time. To hold the power, stakeholders could purchase more tokens.
	**b. Payments**: Projects may use CODR for payments. Also foreign currency payments may require CODR fee.

CODR is political power that can be converted into economic value.
